## The Causal Impacts of Data Science Degree Possession and Experience Numericization in a Competitive Data Science Labor Market


## Description
Our study examines the causal effect of having UC Berkeleyâ€™s online Master of Information and Data Science degree (MIDS) on interview callback rates for data science jobs when compared to other Berkeley graduate degrees. We also measure the effect of using numerical, as opposed to non-numerical, descriptions to depict the achievements and impacts of previous job experiences on the same outcome. To achieve this, we conduct a multi-factor experiment by responding to job postings for data-focused positions with fictitious resumes.
