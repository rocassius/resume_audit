# Experience Numericization Resume Audit
## The Causal Impacts of Data Science Degree Possession and Experience Numericization in a Competitive Data Science Labor Market


## Description
Our study examines the causal effects of two seperate factors on interview callback rates in the data science industry. The first factor is the use of numerical, as opposed to non-numerical, descriptions to depict the achievements and impacts of previous job experiences on one's resume. The second factor is possession of UC Berkeleyâ€™s online Master of Information and Data Science degree (MIDS), as opposed to a traditional master's degree in Statistics. The carefully laid out details of our experimental design and the results of the experiment can both be found in the [paper](https://github.com/rocassius/resume_audit/blob/master/reports/paper.pdf).
